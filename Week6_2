1. Consider the problem of fitting music location and the plots that show the residuals before and after applying the Box-Cox transformation. 
Was this transformation helpful or not?

Ans:
A. The Box-Cox transformation helped a little since R^2 grew without approaching 1

False:
A. The Box-Cox transformation helped a lot since R^2 grew without approaching 1
B. The Box-Cox transformation did not help since R^2 grew
C. The Box-Cox transformation did not help since R^2 didn't change


2. Consider the application of Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression when fitting music latitude. 
What of the following parameters lead to better performance?
Ans:


False:
A. Lasso Regression with log(lambda) around -2 and 17 features considered
B. Lasso Regression with log(lambda) around -2 and 64 features considered


3. Consider the plots produced in the problem of predicting credit card defaults that show the number of non-zero coefficients, 
degrees of freedom, and missclasification error. Which of the following regression model achieves better results?

Ans:
Elastic net with alpha=0.5 and 20 non-zero coefficients (degrees of freedom+1)

False:
A. Lasso with 9 non-zero coefficients (degrees of freedom+1)
B. Ridge with 24 non-zero coefficients (degrees of freedom+1)




4. In the problem of predicting credit card defaults, what is the missclasification error for the regression model that corresponds to the best results?
Ans:
A. Around 0.19

False:
A. Around 0.20
B. Around 0.21
