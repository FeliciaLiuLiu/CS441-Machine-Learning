1.
In the High-Dimensional Classification Programing assignment, we compare the accuracy obtained 
for cross-validation when using up to 5 training items per class to that obtained when using the full set of samples. 
What activities with somewhat high accuracy when using up to 5 training items go to an accuracy of 0 when using the full training set?

Ans:
A. Eat_soup and Lie_down.


False:
A. Sitdown_chair and Use_telephone.
B. Brush_teeth and Eat_meat.



2. Which of the following can be part of the reason why the accuracy changed the way it did in question 1?

Ans:
A. The number of available samples for those activities is among the smallest in the dataset.

False:
A. The number of available samples for those activities is among the highest in the dataset.
B. The number of available samples for those activities is around the average in the dataset.




3. Question 3
In a similar comparison as in question 1, for what activities the accuracy went up from less than 0.5 
when using up to 5 items in the training set to more than 0.7 when using the full training set?

Ans:
A. Pour_water and Standup_chair.

False:
A. Comb_hair and Use_telephone.
B. Walk and Climb_stairs.




4. Which of the following can be part of the reason why the accuracy changed the way it did in question 3?
Ans:
A. The number of available samples for those activities is among the highest in the dataset.

False:
A. The number of available samples for those activities is among the smallest in the dataset.
B. The number of available samples for those activities is around the average in the dataset.
