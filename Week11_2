1. In the programming assignment you segmented the sunset image with initialization_method= 'random_pixels'. 
Try using initialization_method='kmeans' and compare the segmented images with both methods. Select all the options that apply.

Ans:
A. Consider areas that are smoother in the original image. The segmented images initialized through 'kmeans' produce 
more clusters (following more closely the color gradients) than those initialized through 'random_pixels'

B. Highly texturized areas in the original image result in similar segmented images independently of the initialization method used



False:
A. Segmented images look the same independently of the initialization method used



2. In the programming assignment you segmented the sunset image using different numbers of clusters. 
Compare the segmented images in terms of the number of clusters used. Select all the options that apply.

Ans:
A. The higher the number of clusters, the better the segmented image resembles the original image
B. The signature on the bottom right is similar enough to the original image with 20 clusters



False:
A. The sun is only similar to the original image when using 50 clusters and up regardless of the initialization method
