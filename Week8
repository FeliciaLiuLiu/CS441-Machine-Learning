1. Clustering 
Ans:
A. represents each cluster through the cluster center or through a representative item of the cluster
B. groups blobs of close by data

False:
A. when using an agglomerative strategy, it recursively splits the dataset into smaller clusters
B. groups blobs of data according to a provided feature label



2. Agglomerative clustering:
Ans:
A. uses inter-cluster distance as the criterion to decide what clusters to merge
B. starts with a cluster per data item and repetitively merges clusters

False:
A. recursively splits the dataset into smaller clusters
B. requires some criteria to identify what cluster to split and where to split it



3. Group average inter-cluster distance between clusters A and B
Ans:


False:
A. is the distance between the farthest pair of elements (a,b) with a∈A,b∈B



4. Vector quantization
Ans:
A. new pieces of signals or data sources are characterized through a histogram of the codewords that are matched from their patches
B. builds a codebook that results from a clustering process where each cluster represents a codeword
C. is a method that allows us to cluster similar local patterns found in patches from signals or data sources
D. allows to deal with signals or data sources that come at different scales as long as they can be grouped into patches


False:
A. new pieces of signals or data sources do not need to be split into equally sized patches
B. builds a codebook that is a histogram of the feature values in the signals
C. requires that signals or data sources are time sequences




5. Divisive clustering:
Ans:
A. recursively splits the dataset into smaller clusters
B. requires some criteria to identify what cluster to split and where to split it

False:
A. starts with a cluster per data item and repetitively merges clusters
B. uses inter-cluster distance as the criterion to decide what clusters to merge



6. Single-link inter-cluster distance between clusters A and B
Ans:
A. is the distance between the closest pair of elements (a,b) with a∈A,b∈B


False:
A. is the average distance between pairs of elements (a,b) with a∈A,b∈B
B. is the distance between the farthest pair of elements (a,b) with a∈A,b∈B
