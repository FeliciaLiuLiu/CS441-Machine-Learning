1. In the Basic Classification programming assignment, when fitting the features $x^{(i)}$ on a gaussian distribution while  ignoring missing values
Ans:
A. missing values are ignored both when computing the mean and when computing the standard deviation

False:
A. missing values are ignored when computing the mean but are set to 0 when computing the standard deviation



2. In the Basic Classification programming assignment, consider the performance of the Naive Bayes Classifier on evaluation data. 
Which one is more accurate, the one where missing entries are regarded as 0s  (1.2 after Task 4) 
or the one where missing entries are regarded as NANs and ignored (2.1 after Task 6)?
Ans:
A. Similarly accurate when missing entries are kept as 0s than when they are ignored in the computation

False:
A. Less accurate when missing entries are kept as 0s than when they are ignored in the computation 
B. More accurate when missing entries are kept as 0s than when they are ignored in the computation
