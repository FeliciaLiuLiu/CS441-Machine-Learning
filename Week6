1. Some of the difficulties to deal with high-dimensional data include:
Ans:
A. distance between data items in higher dimensions are bigger as dimensionality increases
B. the number of histogram boxes grow significantly with the number of dimensions

False:
A. the noise increases with the number of dimensions
B. scatterplots cannot be used at all


2. A blob in a dataset
Ans:
A. is a subset of nearby points that are farther from other points
B. can be transformed through affine transformations that preserve collinearity and ratios of distances between points


False:
A. has to be analyzed through different tools than those that can be applied to a whole dataset
B. is a compact subset with a fraction of the data and that has the same mean and variance of the whole dataset



3. Mean in a dataset
Ans:
A. is usually computed as a vector that holds the mean for each feature of all items


False:
A. is usually computed as the vector that holds the mean value for each item across all its features



4. In Principal Component Analysis on a dataset or blob with N data items and d features
Ans:
A. we can construct a representation that uses less features than d
B. the subset of features with the largest eigenvalues in the covariance matrix of the dataset are selected
C. 
the error of the model that results of the selection of ss features with respect to the original model 
can be computed as a function of the eigenvalues that correspond to the d-sd−s not selected features

False:
A. we can construct a model with only a subset of the data items of the original set
B. the subset of features with the smallest mean are selected



5. The covariance matrix for a dataset with NN items and dd features
Ans:
A. is a square matrix with d rows and d columns
B. uses Σi,j to hold the covariance between feature i and feature j
C. uses Σi,i to hold the variance of feature i
D. is a symmetric matrix
E. has non-negative eigenvalues


False:
A. holds the covariance between item i and item j at Σi,j
B. is a square matrix with NN rows and NN columns
