1. What is the value of the mean square error in Problem 1 when we apply the linear regression in the original coordinates
(Section 1.1.1 in the notebook)?
Ans:


False:
A. 1.67
B. 52.08


2. Question 2
In Problem 2, we applied linear regression in two scenarios: one in the original coordinates (Section 2.1.1) 
and one for the cubic root of the labels (Sections 2.1.2 and 2.1.3). In your opinion, which one of the two gives a better prediction, and why?
Ans:
A. Original coordinates, because the mean square error is smaller.

False:
A. Cubic root of the labels, because cubic root residuals have smaller values.
B. Cubic root of the labels, because the mean square error is smaller.


3. In Problem 3, we see that the plots have diagonal strips. Why do you think this happens?
Ans:
A. Because the output variable (number of rings) takes integer values.

False:
A. Because the input gender variable is discrete. 
B. Because we use logarithmic transformation. 


4. Based on your observation in Problem 1 of the notebook, 
which of the following relations is more accurate in predicting the variable Y (blood sulfate level) 
based on the variable X (hours since injection)? (here, a^b means a to the power of b)
Ans:



False:
A. Y = a/X ^ b for some a, b > 0
B. Y = aX ^ b for some a, b > 0
