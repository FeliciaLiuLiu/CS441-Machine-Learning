1. Convolution

Ans:
A. can be computed for RGB images through a 3D version where each of the color intensities is encoded as a channel
B. operates using an input image and a kernel which are both arrays with the same number of dimensions
C. results in a large positive value when the pixels in the image match the corresponding pixels in the kernel
D. is a commutative operation



False:
A. is valid for every pixel in an input image regardless of the size of the kernel used
B. operates on an input image which is a 2D array and a kernel which is a 3D array
C. is not commutative


2. when convolutions are taken in strides of length s>1
Ans:
A. s is the number of steps taken in each dimension to move the convolutional kernel to compute the next convolution value
B. the size of the output in each dimension is about the size of the input in each dimension divided by s

False:
A. s is always the same as the number of pixels in the convolutional kernel
B. the size of the output in each dimension is  about the size of the input in each dimension multiplied by s



3. A feature map with xf×yf pixels and $L$ layers taken from images with $x_i \times y_i$ pixels and D channels
Ans:
A. encodes pattern activation in locations in the image
B. can be computed using L kernels represented as tensors of size ki×kj×D
C. Holds the response to a collection of L patterns, or features, in the image and is computed through convolution


False:
A. Holds the response to a collection of $D$ patterns, or features, in the image and is computed through convolution
B. has always the same number of layers as the number of channels in the input




4. sequence of convolutional layers
Ans:
A. have a receptive field with respect to the input to the network 
whose size depends on the settings on previous layers on stride lengths and kernel sizes

False:
A. have a receptive field with respect to the input to the network whose size depends only on the settings on previous layers on kernel sizes






5. Padding
Ans:
A. allows to compute the convolution for every pixel in an input image
B. expands the input image by k pixels on each of the four sides for the computation of the convolution for kernels with 2k+1 rows and columns


False:
A. shrinks the output image to ignore pixels where the convolution is invalid
B. summarizes the pixels that align with the kernels by computing their maximum or their average






6. A convolutional layer
Ans:
A. shares the kernel weights among the convolutional units associated to the same slice on the output feature map
B. is trained to learn kernel weights and biases for its units
C. implements the convolution operation through units whose weights are kernel values
D. outputs a feature map that encodes in each slice the activation patterns encoded in the kernels whose parameters are learned
E. can be setup with parameters that include the number of kernels, the number of channels, the stride length and the padding strategy used



False:
A. is trained to optimize the number of kernels to use
B. has to be connected to a pooling layer always
C. shares no kernel weights among the convolutional units associated to the same slice on the output feature map






7. Convolution
Ans:
A. is invalid for some pixels in an input image for when the kernel has more than one row or more than one column
B. is a linear operation
C. for a given output u,v computes a weighted sum of the pixel values in an image that overlap a kernel centered at u,v that holds the weights



False:
A. cannot be computed as a dot product
B. is a non-linear operation
C. can only be computed for images in levels of grey
