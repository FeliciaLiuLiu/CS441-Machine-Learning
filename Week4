1. Linear regression:
Ans:
A. can be applied to polynomial functions if the explanatory variables incorporate the power terms
B. predicts numerical values for the dependent variable
C. identifies the coefficients of a linear function that minimizes the residuals for the data items in the training set

False:
A. predicts the class a data item belongs to among a discrete set of choices


2. The explanatory variables
Ans:
A. correspond to the features that will be fed to the regression to predict the value of the dependent variable

False:
A. are proportional to the coefficients in the regression (\betaβ)


3. R2 is a measure to estimate the quality of a regression;
Ans:
A. it indicates a good regression when its value is close to 1
B. it is the ratio of the variance of the predictions to the variance of the actual values in the dataset


False:
A. it indicates a good regression when its value is close to 0
B. it has the same units as the dependent variable.



4. Regularization
Ans:
A. requires a regularization coefficient that is determined through cross-validation
B. penalizes large values of the coefficients \betaβ

False:
A. requires a regularization coefficient that can be determined analytically




5. Least squares residuals in linear regression
Ans:
A. are the difference between the actual value of the dependent variable and the prediction generated by the regression

False:
A. have the same units as the explanatory variable with the highest coefficient



6. Standardized residuals
Ans:
A. are obtained by normalizing the residuals through their standard deviation
B. in a good regression behave like a normal random variable with 0 mean

False:
A. in a good regression are all in the range of [0-10]

False:
A. 0.001
B. 0.01



8. In the part 2 of the Assignment (Bank Note Authentication without induced noise), only considering the following values of \lambdaλ, 
which one yields the best validation accuracy when using lasso regularization
Ans:
A. 0.001

False:
A. 0.01
B. 1.0
