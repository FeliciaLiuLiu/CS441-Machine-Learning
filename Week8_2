1. In sklearn.cluster.KMeans, if we do not specify the number of clusters, how many clusters will we have?
Ans:
A. 8

False:
A. 2
B. 4
C. 3



2. For the k-means implementation that we had in the programming assignment, 
for k=2, what is the cluster center for the cluster with label 1? 
(To answer this question, you will need to go back to the programming assignment and write some code to find the answer. 
If you have already submitted the programming assignment, there is no need to re-submit the programming assignment after doing these calculations).

Ans:
A. [44.5,  1.4, 19.6,  0.6,  6.5,  7.3 ,  3.4,  11.2,   5.16]


False:
A. [ 8.2,  1. , 29.1,  1. ,  8.4, 16.3,  5. , 24.2,  6.9]
B. [25. ,  1.8, 28.1,  0.9,  8.7,  9.5,  2.1, 17.1,  6.7]
C. [12.3,  1.2, 29. ,  1. ,  8.6, 14.4,  4.2, 22.4,  6.9]




3. If we have a clustering of N data points in a space with dimension d, what is the range of the silhouettte score?
Ans:
A. [-1,1]

False:
A. [0,N-1]
B. [-d,d]
C. [0,1]



4. For the k-means implementation that we had in the programming assignment, 
for k=2, what is the sum of square distances of the points in cluster 1 with respect to their cluster center? 
(To answer this question, you will need to go back to the programming assignment and write some code to find the answer. 
If you have already submitted the programming assignment, 
there is no need to re-submit the programming assignment after doing these calculations).

Ans:
A. 1301.3

False:
A. 1139.7
B. 1614.5
C. 275.9




5. In sklearn.cluster.KMeans, which of the following parameters governs the number of iterations of the algorithm for a single run?
Ans:



False:
A. tol





6. For the k-means implementation that we had in the programming assignment, for k=3, how many data points fall into the cluster with cluster index 1? 
(To answer this question, you will need to go back to the programming assignment and write some code to find the answer. 
If you have already submitted the programming assignment, there is no need to re-submit the programming assignment after doing these calculations).

Ans:



False:
A. 9
